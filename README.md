# QwikiStatements

Sync and enrich the Wikidata database with data from ORCID and CrossRef. 

[Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Wikidata:Introduction) provides an amazing infrastructure for exploring and discovering [linked research data](https://www.w3.org/standards/semanticweb/data).  The Wikidata community is building tools that allow visualizing these data in unprecedented ways (see [Michael Eisen on Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/author/Q3308179)). Yet these data remain incomplete (see [Michael Eisen on ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7528-738X)) and laborious to update automatically.

With *QwikiStatements* will provide the means to streamline the enrichment of Wikidata by parsing and linking data from ORCID and CrossRef. 


*QwikiStatements* aims to streamline the enrichment of Wikidata by parsing and linking data from [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) and [CrossRef](https://search.crossref.org/), using R and/or Python to bridge in the gap between an [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) profile and [QuickStatments](https://tools.wmflabs.org/quickstatements/).
