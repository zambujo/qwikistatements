# QwikiStatements
Sync and enrich the Wikidata database with data from ORCID and CrossRef. 

Wikidata provides an amazing infrastructure for exploring and discovering linked research data.  The Wikidata community is building tools that allow visualizing these data in unprecedented ways (see [Michael Eisen on Scholia](https://tools.wmflabs.org/scholia/author/Q3308179)). Yet these data remain incomplete (see [Michael Eisen on ORCID](http://orcid.org/0000-0002-7528-738X)) and laborious to update automatically.

With *QwikiStatements* will provide the means to streamline the enrichment of Wikidata by parsing and linking data from ORCID and CrossRef.
